4.  **Test Results**

- Carbon footprint Calculator:

  - JS Code:

> <img src="media/image6.png" style="width:5.57893in;height:3.12801in" />

- Output:

> <img src="media/image7.png" style="width:5.80884in;height:4.43372in" />

- The Above JavaScript code provided is a carbon footprint calculator
  designed to estimate the CO2 emissions generated by different modes of
  transportation based on user input. Upon clicking the calculate
  button, the script retrieves the vehicle type, distance traveled, and
  fuel efficiency from input fields. It then calculates the emissions
  using predefined emission factors for each vehicle type and displays
  the result in the designated container. The calculator promotes
  environmental awareness by allowing users to assess the environmental
  impact of their travel choices.
